<h1 align="center">My Science Fiction Recommendations</h1>

<hr>

<p align="left">Here you'll find some of my favorite science fiction, fantasy, and cosmic horror novels.  I've only become very interested in these genres quite recently, so it's still definitely a list in progress.  I know a good one when I read it, although admittedly my taste tends to veer away from much of the contemporary popular fare.</p>

<table width="60%">
	<tr>
		<td><img src="images/star_maker.jpg" alt="Star Maker"></td>
		<td><p><b>Star Maker by Olaf Stapledon</b><br><br>This one inspired Asimov and Clarke.  CS lewis was also affected by what he perceived to be the perniciousness of its philosophical ideas.  It's not a novel for everyone, but it is unlike any other before or since.  To me it's a philosophical, even poetic, evocation of our place as a species amidst the stars.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="images/arcturus.jpg" alt="Voyage to Arcturus"</td>
		<td><p><b>Voyage to Arcturus by David Lindsay</b><br><br>A fascinating and strange story that very nearly resembles ancient mythological storytelling in its cosmogonic feel and approach.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="images/nightland.jpg" alt="The Night Land"</td>
		<td><p><b>The Night Land</b><br><br>This is one of my favorite novels of all time.  It's at once futuristic sci-fi, dark fantasy, and cosmic horror.  It's a romantic and human-centered story but also foreboding in the way it casts our existence as something dark and limited insofar as our ability to achieve against the backdrop of nature's destructice forces are concerned. </p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="images/borderland.jpg" alt="House on the Borderland"</td>
		<td><p style="font-family:'verdana'">House on the Borderland<br><br></p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="images/lotr.jpg" alt="The Lord of the Rings"</td>
		<td><p style="font-family:'verdana'">The Lord of the Rings<br><br></p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="images/earthabides.jpg" alt="Earth Abides"</td>
		<td><p style="font-family:'verdana'">Earth Abides<br><br></p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
