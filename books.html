<br>These are the books I consider true works of art.  In particular for me there are 4 writers that stand above the others: Nietzsche, Leopardi, Cioran, and Gide.  For me there is little distinction between the greatest and my favorites.  This is because I believe in the power of judgment, that each individual must not only discriminate for themself but also find the inner voice that argues rationally and psychologically why this is the case.  In our fragmented cultural landscape, only the individual aesthetic sense can rise up and create meaning of the world and life through sheer will and contact with the sublime.  Although it may sound like an old cliche, I can find no more serious or invigorating philosophical stance than this.  Of course there is always comedic cynicism, a viable alternative to be sure and here tantalizingly represented by Cioran and Houellebecq, but for me the heroic-romantic stance is ultimately more beautiful.  Between and amongst these two stances lurks the spectre of Epicureanism, the ambiguous and powerful ancient philosophy of pleasure.  It's no wonder writers like Hesse were perennially torn between the mind and the flesh.  These books are the best I've read:
<br><br>

Human, All Too Human (Nietzsche) <br>
The Gay Science (Nietzsche) <br>
Zibaldone (Giacomo Leopardi)  <br>
Collected Aphorisms (EM Cioran) <br>
Fruits of the Earth (Andre Gide)<br>
The Immoralist (Andre Gide)<br>
If it Die... (Andre Gide)<br>
The Lord of the Rings (JRR Tolkien)<br>
The Night Land (William Hope Hodgson)  <br>
Star Maker (Olaf Stapledon)<br>
Complete Novels (Michel Houellebecq)<br>

<p style="font-family:'verdana'"><br>           
<br>And a few more of my "personal bible" books:
<br><br>

Reflections & Maxims (Vouvenargues)<br>
Maxims (La Rochefoucauld)<br>
The Crisis of the European Mind (Paul Hazard)<br>
Revolt of the Masses (Jose Ortega Y Gasset)<br>
The Turning Point (Klaus Mann)<br>
Waste Books (Lichtenberg)<br>
Characters (La Bruyere)<br>
Memoirs from Beyond the Grave (Chateaubriand)<br>
My Life (Benvenuto Cellini) <br>
Alastor (Percy Bysshe Shelley) <br>
The House on the Borderland (William Hope Hodgson)<br>
Narcissus and Goldmund (Hesse)<br>
Swann's Way (Marcel Proust) <br>
How are the Mighty Fallen (Thomas Burnett Swann)<br>
Ishi in Two Worlds (Theodora Kroeber)<br>
Dancer from the Dance (Andrew Holleran)<br>
Candide, Letters (Voltaire)<br>
<br><br>
And here are a few more that strongly influenced my life at one point or another, but for whatever reason I no longer feel quite as close to.  These feel a bit more like a part of my past.  They are certainly more idealistic, less cynical, less humorous you could say, and more overtly spiritual:
<br><br>
Voyage to Arcturus (David Lindsay)<br>
The Idiot (Dostoevsky)<br>
The Bhagavad Gita<br>
The Dhammapada<br>
The Old Man and the Sea (Hemingway)<br>
Heart of Darkness (Conrad)<br>
A History of Christian Thought (Paul Tillich)<br>
The Perennial Philosophy (Aldous Huxley)<br>
History of Sexuality, vol 1 (Michel Foucault)<br>
Siddhartha (Hesse)<br>
The Golden String (Bede Griffiths)<br>
Sadhana: The Realization of Life (Rabindranath Tagore)<br>
Walden (Thoreau)<br>
Systematic Theology (Paul Tillich)<br>
The Magic Mountain (Thomas Mann)<br>
The Gospel of Ramakrishna (Swami Nikhilananda) <br>
Autobiography of a Yogi (Paramahansa Yogananda)<br>
<br><br>
And a few additional contemporary writers of non-fiction I admire:
<br><br>
Enlightenment Now (Steven Pinker)<br>
You are not a Gadget (Jaron Lanier)<br>
The Blind Watchmaker (Richard Dawkins)<br>
Liberalism and its Discontents (Francis Fukuyama)<br>
Dawn to Decadence (Jacques Barzun)<br>
