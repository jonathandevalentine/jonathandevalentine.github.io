<h1 align="center">Philosophers & Writers</h1>

<hr>

<h2 align="left">These are the thinkers and writers I admire and who've influenced me.  I'll try to include one quote with each in order to give a nutshell idea of what struck me as important or remarkable about their work.  They are in roughly chronological order insofar as I've encountered them in my own life.</h2>

<table width="60%">
	<tr>
		<td><img src="tolkien.jpg"></td>
		<td><p>JRR Tolkien<br><br>I first read Tolkien at twenty and to this day his books remain perhaps the most enjoyable and indelible reading experiences I can recall.  If any one person is responsible for my sense of literacy, it's him.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="tillich.jpg"></td>
		<td><p>"Beware of two kinds of people: those who say there is no truth and those who say they know the truth." -Paul Tillich<br><br>A voice strong in both the rational and imaginative aspects, Tillich was a stabilizing presence when I became interested in religion and took the concept of "the meaning of life" very seriously.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="nietzsche.jpg"></td>
		<td><p>"Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies." -Nietzsche<br><br>The most powerful prose writer I know, no one can turn a phrase like Nietzsche.  To this day I've not found a writer whose work I identify with as personally.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="houllebecq.jpg"></td>
		<td><p>-Michel Houllebecq<br><br>A guilty pleasure.  Talented pessimists, cranks and cynics are always welcome on my shelf!</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="stapledon.jpg"></td>
		<td><p>-Olaf Stapledon<br><br>A complex man full of hard truths, writing what is to this day some of the most wide ranging science fiction.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="lindsay.jpg"></td>
		<td><p>-David Lindsay<br><br>A somewhat enigmatic figure who only wrote one great book which itself exudes a philosophical and moral intensity rarely seen in any literature.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="hodgeson.jpg"></td>
		<td><p>-William Hope Hodgeson<br><br>An early amateur body-builder, trans-oceanic sailor, war hero, inspired writer of apocalyptic cosmic horror, and all around handsome guy WHH.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="leopardi.jpg"></td>
		<td><p>-Giacomo Leopardi<br><br>Outside Nietzsche I can think of no more inspired work than the Zibaldone.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="jefferson.jpg"></td>
		<td><p>-Thomas Jefferson<br><br>Jefferson was a complex and lively character, and I appreciate him for his internal tensions, inspired insights, and historical role.  He's one of those figures around whom one becomes familiarized with an entire cultural, intellectual and political epoch.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="cioran.jpg"></td>
		<td><p>-EM Cioran<br><br>The standup comedian at the end of Western Civilization... or something.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="huxley.jpg"></td>
		<td><p>-Aldous Huxley<br><br>In his breadth of knowledge endlessly fascinating, Huxley makes for the ultimate cultural, artistic, literary and philosophical brain candy.</p></td>
	</tr>
