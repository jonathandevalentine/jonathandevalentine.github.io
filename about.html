		<p style="font-family:'verdana'"><br><br>Obviously this site is in progress.  I plan on finishing it out soon.  Please come back at a later date to find philosophical musings, quotes, and interesting links.  
<br><br>
The site is designed to be simple, direct and individualistic in the style of the 90s html I learned as a teenager.  Each page is hand coded by me using a text editor (maybe you can tell!).  
<br><br>
It seems like we've forgotten how to experiment with and express ourselves through the internet because the only avenues left are the social media giants.  Most of what you encounter on the web isn't human anymore: it's automation.  So this website is a kind of last stand of human against machine.  No advertising, no networking, no reputation to curate.  In the end futile perhaps, but valiant nonetheless.  And if I can do it with my almost non-existent coding knowledge then so can others!
<br><br>
So please enjoy and come back soon.
