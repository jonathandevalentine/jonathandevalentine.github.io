<h1 align="center">Selected Aphorisms</h1>

<h2>It's a gargantuan task to collect all of your favorite sayings, but here are a few of the very best I've managed to collect from my reading.  I've tried to include only those aphorisms which speak directly to what it means to live a good life, to be happy, or in some way have a fundamental insight. As opposed to maxims or epigrams, the word aphorism I believe carries a more full meaning: that which not only speaks pithily and/or with moral force but which also gives some counterintuive, jolt-like insight into life.  I'm not even sure this is a complete list, so expect more to be added some day.  Enjoy!</h2>

		<td><p style="font-family:'verdana'">Dogs, like men, are punished for their loyalty.<br>
-Chateaubriand
<br><br><br>
Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies.<br>
-Nietzsche
<br><br><br>
We must not be too afraid of being deceived.<br>
-Vouvenargues
<br><br><br>
The best philosophy, relative to the world, is an alliance between the sarcasm that comes from gaiety and the indulgence that comes with scorn.<br>
-Chamfort
<br><br><br>
Life should not be too closely regulated or too methodical.<br>
-Bertrand Russell
<br><br><br>
In major perplexities, try to live as if history were done with and to react like a monster riddled by serenity.<br>
-Cioran
<br><br><br>
A patrimony all our own: the hours when we have done nothing… It is they that form us, that individualize us, that make us dissimilar.<br>
-Cioran
<br><br><br>
Write books only if you are going to say in them the things you would never dare confide to anyone.<br>
-Cioran
<br><br><br>
Nothing desiccates a mind so much as its repugnance to conceive obscure ideas.<br>
-Cioran
<br><br><br>
The qualities we have never make us as absurd as those we pretend to have.<br>
-La Rochefoucauld
<br><br><br>
We are sometimes as different from ourselves as we are from other people.<br>
-La Rochefoucauld
<br><br><br>
Love of glory, fear of shame, a plan to make our fortune, a desire to make our lives comfortable and attractive, and a wish to demean other people, are often the causes of the valor that men praise so highly.<br>
-La Rochefoucauld
<br><br><br>
We ought to treat fortune like health: enjoy it when it is good, be patient when it is bad, and never use drastic remedies except in a case of absolute necessity.<br>
-La Rochefoucauld
<br><br><br>
Supreme cleverness lies in knowing the exact value of things.<br>
-La Rochefoucauld
<br><br><br>
Confidence contributes more to conversation than intelligence does.<br>
-La Rochefoucauld
<br><br><br>
Nothing prevents us from being natural as much as the wish to look natural.<br>
-La Rochefoucauld
<br><br><br>
We would gain more by showing ourselves as we are than by trying to appear to be what we are not.<br>
-La Rochefoucauld
<br><br><br>
It is impossible to have bad taste, but many have none at all.<br>
-Lichtenberg
<br><br><br>
To start on a thing straightaway without putting it off for a minute, much less an hour or a day, is a way of making time expand.<br>
-Lichtenberg
<br><br><br>
No work, and especially no work of literature, should display the effort it has cost. A writer who wants to be read by posterity must not neglect to drop into odd corners of his chapters such hints at whole books, ideas for disputations, that his readers will believe he has thousands of them to throw away.<br>
-Lichtenberg
<br><br><br>
Many people know everything they know in the way we know the solution of a riddle after we have read it or been told it, and that is the worst kind of knowledge and the kind least to be cultivated; we ought rather to cultivate that kind of knowledge which enables us to discover for ourselves in case of need that which others have to read or be told of in order to know it.<br>
